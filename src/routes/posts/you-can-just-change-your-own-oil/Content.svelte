		The great irony of the modern internet is that after collecting, digitizing,
		and indexing the sum of human knowledge it's still exceedingly difficult to
		find answers to some very basic questions like 'how do I change my engine
		oil'. When you google 'how do I change my engine oil' almost every result is
		a sales pitch written to trick you into clicking affiliate links. The
		content you see first in a google search is not ranked by how helpful it is
		but by how optimized it is for being seen first in a google search.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first google search result I was shown is an

		a high price tag for the required materials.
	</p>
	<p>
		But the article is doing exactly what is was designed to do by Car and
		Driver Magazine: ranking high in google search results and getting clicks.
		Unfortunately, success at ranking highly in google search results and
		getting affiliate link clicks is only tangentially related to an article's
		ability to teach you how to change engine oil.

	<p>
		I wanted to write this guide to show readers how simple it is to start doing
		their own vehicle maintenance and out of spite for what advertising and a

	<p>
		Engine oil sits in a large tank accessible from the underbelly of your car
		called an oil pan. Somewhere on the oil pan is a drain that is kept plugged
		with a small drain plug bolt. Removing the drain plug bolt requires a socket
		wrench. The socket size required to fit the drain plug bolt is not
		universal. Any socket wrench set will include a socket that fits your drain
		plug.

	</p>
	<h2 id="lifting-your-car">Lifting Your Car</h2>
	<p>
		The oil filter housing and oil pan are usually not accessible without first
		lifting your car. There are two inexpensive methods for lifting your
		vehicle.
	</p>
	<h3 id="ramps">Ramps</h3>
	<p>
		The first option is to drive your car up a set of wheel ramps. This method
		is inexpensive and safe. Driving your car up the ramps can be tricky and
		having a second person to direct you will help. Once on the ramp wheel
		chocks must be placed behind the back tires to ensure it will not roll
		backwards.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src={wheel_ramps} alt="wheel ramps" />
	</p>
	<p>
		The biggest drawback of using ramps is that the wheels cannot be removed
		while elevated. Tasks like brake pad and rotor replacement will require a
		hydraulic jack. The ramps are also quite large and will take up a lot of
		storage space.
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>

			wheel chocks, $6, amazon
		</a>
	</p>
	<h3 id="hydraulic-floor-jack">Hydraulic Floor Jack</h3>
	<p>
		A hydraulic floor jack is the easiest way to elevate your vehicle. The only
		tricky part is finding your car's lift points but you only have to do this
		once. The lift point location can usually be found in your vehicle's owner's
		manual. Googling '<strong><strong>*</strong></strong>your car year, make,
		model<strong><strong>*</strong></strong> jack point' will also work. Once your
		car is elevated jack stands must be placed under the frame to catch your car
		if the jack fails and wheel chocks placed behind the wheels to prevent your car
		from rolling backwards.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src={jack_point} alt="jack point instructions" />
	</p>
	<p>
		When purchasing a hydraulic floor jack ensure that it is sufficient for the
		weight of your vehicle. Many inexpensive floor jacks on amazon are rated for
		only 1.5 tons which will not lift a standard sedan. A standard sedan will
		usually weigh around 2 tons and trucks will weigh anywhere between 2 and 4
		tons. A low-set car may require a specialized low profile hydraulic floor
		jack.
	</p>
	<p>
		A hydraulic floor jack is more expensive than wheel ramps but will pay for
		itself after a few engine oil and brake pad replacements. Their biggest
		advantage over wheel ramps is that they can be used to elevate your car with
		the wheels removed for work on brake and wheel maintenance tasks. Hydraulic
		floor jacks are also easier to store than wheel ramps.

	</p>
	<h2>Waste Oil Collection and Storage</h2>
	<p>
		Once the drain plug bolt is removed oil will flow freely from the oil pan.
		You will need to have a vessel waiting below the drain to collect the waste
		oil. The most hassle-free method is to use a combined oil collection and
		storage container like the one pictured below. Waste oil is collected
		through the opening on the broad side of the container and can then be
		dumped out later through the top hole.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src={waste_oil_vessel} alt="waste oil collection and storage vessel" />
	</p>
	<p>
		For some reason these are difficult to find on amazon. The smaller 10 quart
		oil pans will likely be insufficient to hold two oil changes worth of waste
		oil and will necessitate disposal after every oil change.

	<h2 id="oil-filter-removal-tool">Oil Filter Removal Tool</h2>
	<p>
		Oil filters are contained in different types of housing and found in all
		different locations and orientations. Different tools are required depending
		on the vehicle.
	</p>
	<p>
		The easiest way to determine which tool to buy is by googling
		<span class="italic">'your car year make model oil change'</span>
		and noting what tools people are using in tutorial videos.
	</p>
	<h3 id="toyota-oil-filter-housing-removal-tool">
		Toyota Oil Filter Housing Removal Tool
	</h3>
	<p>
		Toyota oil filter housings are very easily removed with a socket wrench
		attachment. These tools will also work on Lexus cars.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src={toyota_oil_filter_tool} alt="toyota oil filter tool" />
	</p>
	<p>
		Ensure that the Toyota oil filter housing removal tool you choose will fit
		on your socket wrench head. Common socket wrench heads include 1/4”, 3/8”,
		and 1/2”.

	</p>
	<h3 id="oil-filter-swivel-wrench">Oil Filter Swivel Wrench</h3>
	<p>
		Oil filter swivel wrenches work by wrapping tightly around the oil filter
		housing/canister to create a handle with which it can be twisted out.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src={oil_filter_swivel_wrench} alt="oil filter swivel wrench" />
	</p>
	<p>
		Swivel wrenches are useful for loosening oil filter housing/canisters enough
		to remove fully by hand or with pliers.

	<h3 id="oil-filter-pliers">Oil Filter Pliers</h3>
	<p>
		Oil filter pliers are the most 'universal' oil filter removal tool. They
		provide the least grip on the oil housing/canister but should work on most
		any vehicle.

	</p>
	<h2 id="engine-oil">Engine Oil</h2>
	<div>
		There are two details to pay attention to when buying engine oil: viscocity
		rating and type.
	</div>
	<p>
		Viscosity rating measures the oil's ability to lubricate at extreme
		temperatures. It's written as something like '0W-20' with different numbers
		for different ratings. Your owner's manual will usually give you a
		recommended engine oil viscosity. Googling
		<span class="italic"> 'your car year, make, model oil type' </span>
		or searching your car on
		<a
			href="https://www.rockauto.com/"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer"
		>
			RockAuto
		</a> will also work.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second consideration when buying engine oil is choosing between
		synthetic, blend, or conventional oils. Synthetic oil is better for your car
		and will last longer than other types but it costs a little more. Many newer
		cars may require synthetic oil. There's little reason to choose anything
		other than synthetic oil.
	</p>
	<p>
		Synthetic engine oil brands are all comparable and there's no reason to pay
		more for one brand over another. See the

	</p>
	<p>
		Specialty shops like Autozone and O'reilly sell motor oil at a significant
		markup compared to Costco, Amazon, and Walmart. The amount of oil you'll
		need to buy depends on your engine's oil capacity but 10 quarts should be
		sufficient for most cars.
	</p>

	</p>
	<h2 id="oil-filter">Oil Filter</h2>
	<p>
		Engine oil filters are replaced every time you replace your engine oil. The
		easiest way to find the correct oil filter is to use
		<a href="http://rockauto.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
			RockAuto
		</a>
		or by googling
		<span class="italic">'your car year, make, model oil filter'</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The safest brand is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) but you'll be
		fine buying anything but maybe the absolute cheapest filters. RockAuto does
		a nice job sorting parts into tiers and identifying the most popular brands.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you don't want to order online from RockAuto or Amazon then Walmart will
		likely have your vehicle's oil filter on the shelf. Do not buy your oil
		filter from specialty stores like Autozone or O'reilly. In the below example
		the same filter is sold for 3x the price from Autozone compared to RockAuto.

	</div>
	<p>
		Oil filters will differ between manufacturers and models. The filter
		pictured above is placed in a permanent canister. In some cars both the
		filter and canister is replaced.
	</p>
	<h2 id="misc-materials">Misc Materials</h2>
	<h3 id="oil-cleanup">Oil Cleanup</h3>
	<p>
		You're likely to spill some oil the first few times you change your engine
		oil. Shop towels are great for small cleanup and are inexpensive at Costco
		and Walmart. In the case of big oil spills cat litter or wood dust can be
		used to absorb the spill and then be swept up.
	</p>

	<h3 id="breaker-bar">Breaker Bar</h3>
	<p>
		Breaker bars are socket wrenches with extended handles to increase your
		leverage on a bolt. It's unlikely that you will require a breaker bar for an
		oil change. However, some less conscientious auto mechanics may have
		over-tightened the bolts on your vehicle with power tools so it's nice to
		have a breaker bar on hand just in case. Ensure the breaker bar head is the
		same size as the socket you're fitting on it.

	</p>
	<h3 id="oil-measurement">Oil Measurement</h3>
	<p>
		Most oil bottles have volume markings that can be used to measure how much
		oil you're adding to your car. This is usually sufficient but a measuring
		pitcher can be used to make it easier to pour the exact amount.

	</p>
	<h1 id="instructions">Instructions</h1>
	<p>
		The best way to teach yourself how to change your engine oil is to find a
		video tutorial specific to your car. Googling
		<span class="italic"> 'your car year, make, model oil change' </span>
		will usually yield hundreds of results. Cars are manufactured in 'generations'
		where the same construction is used for around 5 years. Finding a tutorial for
		a car of the same make and model as yours with a different year but within the
		same generation will usually be sufficient.
	</p>
	<p>
		The instructions given below are not exhaustive and should be considered a
		supplement to a video tutorial that is specific to your vehicle.
	</p>
	<h3 id="1-lift-car-">1. <strong>Lift Car</strong></h3>
	<p>Elevate your car using your preferred method.</p>
	<h3 id="2-drain-oil-">2. <strong>Drain Oil</strong></h3>
	<p>
		Position your oil collection vessel below the vehicle's oil pan drain plug
		bolt. If the bolt is at an angle ensure that the oil collection vessel is
		positioned to account for the trajectory of the draining oil. A good way to
		control the flow of oil is to keep the drain plug bolt pressed against the
		oil pan while you're unscrewing it. This will prevent the oil from dripping
		over your arms and tools.
	</p>
	<p>
		The oil will initially come out very quickly and eventually slow to a drip.
		You should wait until all the oil has been emptied before putting the drain
		plug bolt back on. The oil filter can be replaced while waiting for the oil
		pan to drain.
	</p>
	<h3 id="3-replace-filter">3. Replace Filter</h3>
	<p>
		The specifics of replacing your oil filter will depend on the vehicle.
		Before removing your oil filter note the small pieces, if any, that are
		packaged with the filter. Most oil filter kits will include a rubber O-ring
		used to maintain a seal between the oil filter housing and your vehicle.
		Find these parts on your old filter once removed and replace them with the
		new ones.
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that the filter will be saturated in oil and care should be
		taken that it won't spill when being removed. Oil will drain from where the
		filter housing was removed but this should subside before the oil pan has
		been drained.
	</p>
	<h3 id="4-re-plug-oil-pan">4. Re-Plug Oil Pan</h3>
	<p>
		Return the oil drain plug bolt back into the oil pan. Tighten the bolt using
		your socket wrench until you meet resistance plus one little shove.
	</p>
	<h3 id="5-fill-car-with-new-oil">5. Fill Car with New Oil</h3>
	<p>
		Your car's oil capacity can be found in the owner's manual or by Googling
		<span class="italic">'your car year make model oil capacity'</span>. Before
		you begin filling your car with oil consider whether or not the oil drain
		plug is in and the oil filter is secured.
	</p>
	<h3 id="6-check-oil-level">6. Check Oil Level</h3>
	<p>
		Your car will have a rod used to test the oil level of your vehicle called a
		dipstick. You can usually find the dipstick by looking for a yellow ring
		somewhere in the engine bay.
	</p>
	<p>
		The bottom of the dipstick sits partway inside the oil tank and will have
		markings indicating the recommended oil level. Before checking your engine's
		oil level see if your owner's manual recommends checking after running the
		engine or if it can be checked cold. Also make sure your car is level and no
		longer elevated.
	</p>
	<h1 id="misc">Misc</h1>
	<h2 id="waste-oil-disposal">Waste Oil Disposal</h2>
	<p>
		Most specialty shops like Autozone and O'reilly provide free waste oil
		disposal. Please don't dump your oil in the ground.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src={waste_oil_disposal} alt="IMG_9024.JPG" />
	</p>
	<h2 id="stuck-bolts">Stuck Bolts</h2>
	<p>
		Occasionally you will encounter a bolt that will not break loose. Before you
		try pulling even harder consider the damage you may be doing to the head of
		the bolt. Applying too much force to the head of a bolt may begin to round
		the edges making it even more difficult to remove. Taking your car to an
		auto shop and having a professional remove the stuck bolt is usually the
		best option for amateurs.
