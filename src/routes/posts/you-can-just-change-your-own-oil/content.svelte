	<p>
		When I asked my grandpa how he learned how to change his car's engine oil he
		didn't understand what I was asking him. Part of owning a car (or any
		gasoline powered equipment) was knowing how to maintain it. Knowing how to
		do the basic maintenance tasks required to keep a car running was a
		necessary part of using a car.
	</p>
	<p>
		Part of what makes it difficult to learn how to change your own engine oil
		is <span class="italic">how easy</span> it is to do. There's a strong dunning-krueger
		like effect where once one sees how simple it is they forget that there was ever
		a time when they didn't know how to do it. Overestimation of their reader's familiarity
		with auto maintenance is apparent in many beginners' guides.
	</p>
	<p>
		The primary reason it's difficult to self-teach engine oil replacement is
		that most content you'll find from google is written by copywriters trying
		to make you click affiliate links. Below is a screenshot of <a

		Not a single one of these items is necessary to change your own engine oil.
		Car and Driver Magazine wrote this article not to teach you how to change
		your own engine oil but to trick you into clicking affiliate links.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most other articles you'll find are similarly unhelpful. Using the internet
		to learn how to change your engine oil is now a task of filtering out sales

	<h2 id="socket-wrench">Socket Wrench</h2>
	<p>
		Engine oil sits in a large tank accessible from the underbelly of your car
		called an oil pan. Somewhere on the oil pan is a drain that is kept plugged
		with a small drain plug bolt. Removing the drain plug bolt requires a socket
		wrench. The socket size required to fit the drain plug bolt is not
		universal. Any socket wrench set will include a socket that fits your drain
		plug.

	<h2 id="lifting-your-car">Lifting Your Car</h2>
	<p>
		The oil filter housing and oil pan are usually not accessible without first
		lifting your car. There are two inexpensive methods for lifting your
		vehicle.
	</p>
	<h3 id="ramps">Ramps</h3>
	<p>
		The first option is to drive your car up a set of wheel ramps. This method
		is inexpensive and safe. Driving your car up the ramps can be tricky and
		having a second person to direct you will help Once on the ramp wheel chocks
		must be placed behind the back tires to ensure it will not roll backwards.
	</p>

			alt="71kZjYrioqL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"
		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		The biggest drawback of using ramps is that the wheels cannot be removed
		while elevated. Tasks like brake pad and rotor replacement will require a
		hydraulic jack. The ramps are also quite large and will take up a lot of
		storage space.

	<h3 id="hydraulic-floor-jack">Hydraulic Floor Jack</h3>
	<p>
		A hydraulic floor jack is the easiest way to elevate your vehicle. The only
		tricky part is finding your car's lift points but you only have to do this
		once. The lift point location can usually be found in your vehicle's owner's
		manual. Googling '<strong><strong>*</strong></strong>your car year, make,
		model<strong><strong>*</strong></strong> jack point' will also work. Once your
		car is elevated jack stands must be placed under the frame to catch your car
		if the jack fails and wheel chocks placed behind the wheels to prevent your car
		from rolling backwards.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img

		/>
	</p>
	<p>
		When purchasing a hydraulic floor jack ensure that it is sufficient for the
		weight of your vehicle. Many inexpensive floor jacks on amazon are rated for
		only 1.5 tons which will not lift a standard sedan. A standard sedan will
		usually weigh around 2 tons and trucks will weigh anywhere between 2 and 4
		tons. A low-set car may require a specialized low profile hydraulic floor
		jack.
	</p>
	<p>
		A hydraulic floor jack is more expensive than wheel ramps but will pay for
		itself after a few engine oil and brake pad replacements. Their biggest
		advantage over wheel ramps is that they can be used to elevate your car with
		the wheels removed for work on brake and wheel maintenance tasks. Hydraulic
		floor jacks are also easier to store than wheel ramps.

		Waste Oil Storage and Collection
	</h2>
	<p>
		Once the drain plug bolt is removed oil will flow freely from the oil pan.
		You will need to have a vessel waiting below the drain to collect the waste
		oil. The most hassle-free method is to use a combined oil collection and
		storage container like the one pictured below. Waste oil is collected
		through the opening on the broad side of the container and can then be
		dumped out later through the top hole.

	<p>
		For some reason these are difficult to find on amazon. The smaller 10 quart
		oil pans will likely be insufficient to hold two oil changes worth of waste
		oil and will necessitate disposal after every oil change.

	<h2 id="engine-oil">Engine Oil</h2>
	<p>
		There are two details to pay attention to when buying engine oil. The first
		is the viscosity rating which is written something like '0W-20' with
		differing numbers. Your owner's manual will usually have give you a
		recommended engine oil viscosity. Googling '<strong
			><strong><strong><strong>**</strong></strong></strong></strong
		>your car year, make, model<strong
			><strong><strong><strong>**</strong></strong></strong></strong
		>
		oil type' or searching your car on
		<a href="https://www.rockauto.com/">RockAuto</a> will also work.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second consideration when buying engine oil is choosing synthetic,
		blend, or conventional. There's little reason to choose anything other than
		synthetic oil.
	</p>
	<p>
		Synthetic engine oil brands are all comparable and there's little reason to
		pay more for one brand over another. See the <a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ProjectFarm">Project Farm</a
		> youtube channel for an exhaustive analysis of different brands' engine oils

	<p>
		Specialty shops like Autozone and O'reilly sell motor oil at a significant
		markup compared to Costco, Amazon, and Walmart. The amount of oil you'll
		need to buy depends on your engine's oil capacity.
	</p>
	<p>

		>
	</p>
	<h2 id="oil-filter">Oil Filter</h2>
	<p>
		Engine oil filters are replaced every time you replace your engine oil. The
		easiest way to find the correct oil filter is to use RockAuto or by googling
		'<strong><strong><strong><strong>**</strong></strong></strong></strong>your
		car year, make, model<strong
			><strong><strong><strong>**</strong></strong></strong></strong
		> oil filter'.
	</p>
	<p>
		The safest brand is always the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) but
		you'll be fine buying anything but maybe the absolute cheapest filters.
		RockAuto does a nice job sorting parts into tiers and identifying the most
		popular brands.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you don't want to order online from RockAuto or Amazon then Walmart will
		likely have your vehicle's oil filter on the shelf. Do not buy your oil
		filter from specialty stores like Autozone or O'reilly. In the below example
		the same filter is sold for 3x the price from Autozone compared to RockAuto.

	<h3 id="oil-cleanup">Oil Cleanup</h3>
	<p>
		You're likely to spill oil somewhere the first few times you change your

		Costco and Walmart. In the case of big oil spills cat litter or wood dust
		can be used to absorb the spill and then be swept up.

	<h3 id="breaker-bar">Breaker Bar</h3>
	<p>
		Breaker bars are socket wrenches with extended handles to increase your
		leverage on a bolt. It's unlikely that you will require a breaker bar for an
		oil change. However, some less conscientious auto mechanics may have
		over-tightened the bolts on your vehicle with power tools so it's nice to
		have a breaker bar on hand just in case. Ensure the breaker bar head is the
		same size as the socket you're fitting on it.

	<h1 id="instructions">Instructions</h1>
	<p>
		The best way to teach yourself how to change your engine oil is to find a
		tutorial online. Googling '<strong
			><strong><strong><em>*</em></strong></strong></strong
		>your car year, make, model<strong
			><strong><strong><em>*</em></strong></strong></strong
		> oil change' will usually yield hundreds of results. Cars are manufactured in
		'generations' where the same construction is used for around 5 years. Finding
		a tutorial for a car of the same make and model as yours with a different year
		but within the same generation will usually be sufficient.
	</p>
	<p>
		The instructions given below are not exhaustive and should be considered a
		supplement to a video tutorial that is specific to your vehicle.
	</p>
	<h3 id="1-lift-car-">1. <strong>Lift Car</strong></h3>
	<p>Elevate your car using your preferred method.</p>
	<h3 id="2-drain-oil-">2. <strong>Drain Oil</strong></h3>
	<p>
		Position your oil collection vessel below the vehicle's oil pan drain plug
		bolt. If the bolt is at an angle ensure that the oil collection vessel is
		positioned to account for the trajectory of the draining oil. A good way to
		control the flow of oil is to keep the drain plug bolt pressed against the
		oil pan while you're unscrewing it. This will prevent the oil from dripping
		over your arms and tools.
	</p>
	<p>
		The oil will initially come out very quickly and eventually slow to a drip.
		You should wait until all the oil has been emptied before putting the drain
		plug bolt back on. The oil filter can be replaced while waiting for the oil
		pan to drain.
	</p>
	<h3 id="3-replace-filter">3. Replace Filter</h3>
	<p>
		The specifics of replacing your oil filter will depend on the vehicle.
		Before removing your oil filter note the small pieces, if any, that are
		packaged with the filter. Most oil filter kits will include a rubber O-ring
		used to maintain a seal between the oil filter housing and your vehicle.
		Find these parts on your old filter once removed and replace them with the
		new ones.
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that the filter will be saturated in oil and care should be
		taken that it won't spill when being removed. Oil will drain from where the
		filter housing was removed but this should subside before the oil pan has
		been drained.

		Return the oil drain plug bolt back into the oil pan. Tighten the bolt using
		your socket wrench until you meet resistance plus one little shove.

	<p>
		Your car's oil capacity can be found in the owner's manual or by googling '<strong
			><strong><strong><strong>**</strong></strong></strong></strong
		>your car year, make, model<strong
			><strong><strong><strong>**</strong></strong></strong></strong
		> oil capacity'. Before you begin filling your car with oil consider whether
		or not the oil drain plug is in and the oil filter is secured.
	</p>
	<h3 id="6-check-oil-level">6. Check Oil Level</h3>
	<p>
		Your car will have a rod used to test the oil level of your vehicle called a
		dipstick. You can usually find the dipstick by looking for a yellow ring
		somewhere in the engine bay.
	</p>
	<p>
		The bottom of the dipstick sits partway inside the oil tank and will have
		markings indicating the recommended oil level. Before checking your engine's
		oil level see if your owner's manual recommends checking after running the
		engine or if it can be checked cold. Also make sure your car is level and no
		longer elevated.

	<p>
		Most specialty shops like Autozone and O'reilly will provide free waste oil
		disposal. Please don't dump your oil in the ground.

	<h2 id="stuck-bolts">Stuck Bolts</h2>
	<p>
		Occasionally you will encounter a bolt that will not break loose. Before you
		try pulling even harder consider the damage you may be doing to the head of
		the bolt. Applying too much force to the head of a bolt may begin to round
		the edges making it even more difficult to remove. Taking your car to an
		auto shop and having a professional remove the stuck bolt is usually the
		best option for amateurs.
